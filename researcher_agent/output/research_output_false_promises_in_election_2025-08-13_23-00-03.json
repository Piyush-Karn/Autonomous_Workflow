Over the past 30 years, Democratic and Republican congresspeople voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.[2]\nFulfilling promises [ edit ]\nA 2017 study in the American Journal of Political Science found that for 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) found that political parties fulfill their promises to voters to a considerable extent:[1]\nParties that hold executive office after elections generally fulfill substantial percentages, sometimes very high percentages, of their election pledges, whereas parties that do not hold executive office generally find that lower percentages of their pledges are fulfilled. The fulfillment of pledges by governing executive parties varies across governments in ways that reflect power-sharing arrangements. The main power-sharing arrangement that impacts pledge fulfillment distinguishes between single-party governments and coalitions, not between governments with and without legislative majorities. We found the highest percentages of pledge fulfillment for governing parties in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Canada, most of which governed in single-party executives. We found lower percentages for governing parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Italy, most of which governed in coalitions. Pledge fulfillment by U.S. presidential parties lies at the higher end of coalition governments, which suggests that U.S. presidents are more constrained than governing parties in single-party parliamentary systems, but less constrained than most governing parties in multiparty coalitions.[excessive quote]\nOther research on the United States suggests that Democratic and Republican congresspeople voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.[2]\nExamples of broken promises [ edit ]\nSee also [ edit ]\nNotes [ edit ]",

      "text": "'Punish or deter outrageously false campaign promises'\nPoll chancers: politicians who make false promises must be punished.\nPoliticians knowingly making promises during elections campaigns that are pie-in-the-sky, should be investigated by the Independent Electoral Commission for undermining voters’ ability to make informed choices.\nKnowingly making false, unachievable and illegal campaign promises amounts to a political lie, breaches ethics and honesty.\nIt is intended to deliberately deceive voters – many of whom are desperate, illiterate and do not know better. It now appears that even political campaign speeches have been “captured”.\nOutrageously false campaign promises undermine the credibility, legitimacy and trust in the country’s electoral system – and also in politics broadly.\nIncreasingly ahead of elections political leaders and parties are making false, unrealistic and unattainable promises in order to get the votes. Making false and unrealistic promises are unethical, immoral and irresponsible.\nIt shows a shocking disregard for the truth. Leaders and parties show their disrespect for poor, desperate and illiterate voters by promising them things that are patently undeliverable. Making such promises are not in the best interests of the constituencies they purport to serve, neither is it in the best interests of the country.\nFalse promises also undermine the credibility of information given to voters to base their voting decisions on. False campaign information, particularly in a society such as South Africa with high levels of illiteracy, with rural and township citizens who often do not have access to credible information, undermines the credibility of truthful, fact-based and evidence-based information, as unknowing ordinary citizens believe the false information they receive from cynical politicians and political parties.\nVoters cannot make informed voting decisions based on false election campaign promises. False campaign promises undermine the sacred power of the vote itself.\nIt also undermines open public debate over policy choices to be decided on because campaign promises are based on untruths.\nIt also shows the hunger for power for its own sake that many political leaders and parties that would say anything to be elected to be part of the gravy train of high salaries, perks and access to patronage.\nCertainly, since the end of apartheid, populism has regrettably become a dominant strand of South Africa’s politics. Unscrupulous politicians tell desperate voters what they want to hear, even if such promises cannot be fulfilled, just to get into power.\nFormer ANC and South African President Jacob Zuma was the master of populism, and in the 2014 national elections campaign promised six million new jobs and five million new houses. In the run-up to the ANC’s 2017 national conference he promised free higher education for the poor and working class students, in spite of the National Treasury and the 2017 Heher Commission into the Feasibility of Fee-Free Higher Education and Training saying universal free higher education was unaffordable.\nFollowing week-long protests by disgruntled Alexandra residents in April 2019 over runaway, lack of housing and the proliferation of drugs dens, President Cyril Ramaphosa promises the residents the government will build one million new houses over five years for the area.\nStephen D Sencer, a US political scientist argues that election campaign speeches are unique in the sense that the “same standards of accuracy to which other forms of speech held” are not always strictly applied to campaign speeches, because in many cases political campaign speeches are largely political rhetoric.\nNevertheless, during this elections campaign for the 1 November 2021 local elections, the Economic Freedom Fighters took unrealistic promises to astonishingly new lows. Although this is the elections for local government, the EFF has made some promises that are not within the competence of the local sphere, but falls under the auspices of national government.\nAmong the promises of EFF leader Julius Malema, includes increasing current social grants payments by 100%, children of social grant recipients will get free education at school and higher education institutions and that water and power will be free for all social grant recipients. Ordinarily, local government cannot introduce such new policies, only national government can.\nOf course, it is very difficult for ordinary citizens to seek legal recourse to hold politicians to account who make wild promises – beyond not voting for such leaders and parties. However, there has to be a way to hold politicians and parties accountable for making false campaign promises.\nIn 1964, the US Supreme Court, pronounced that deliberately false speech by politicians would not enjoy constitutional protection in the US. The US Supreme Court said: “For the use of the known lie as a tool is at once at odds with the premises of democratic government and with the orderly manner in which economic, social, or political change is to be effected. Calculated falsehood falls into that class of utterances which ‘are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality ....’ Hence the knowingly false statement and the false statement made with reckless disregard of the truth, do not enjoy constitutional protection”.\nThe IEC may have to look at regulations to either punish or deter outrageously false campaign promises. The best way to stop the proliferation of false promises in elections, is for voters simply not to vote for political parties and leaders who make false claims, promises and statements. This would hopefully in the future deter political parties and leaders from making false campaign promises.\nWilliam Gumede is Associate Professor at the School of Governance, University of the Witwatersrand and author of Restless Nation: Making Sense of Troubled Times (Tafelberg).

      "text": "The conventional wisdom holds that politicians can’t be trusted to keep their promises, yet decades of research across numerous advanced democracies shows the opposite. In truth, political parties reliably carry out the bulk of their campaign pledges, especially in majoritarian systems like Westminster.\nAt a time of such political cynicism, the average voter could be forgiven for doubting this claim. The idea that politicians are insincere about their campaign pledges is reflected in public beliefs about election pledge fulfilment. When Chris Carman and I ran a survey earlier in 2019, the findings of which will be published in an upcoming John Smith Centre report, we asked respondents whether they agreed that “the people we elect as MPs try to keep the promises they made during the election campaign”.\nFraser McMillan/John Smith Centre\nOf the 1,435 respondents who offered an opinion, fewer than one in three agreed, while more than half disagreed. Citizens seem to have little faith that the policies they endorse at the ballot box will ever come to fruition. But the truth is actually rather different.\nPromises made, promises kept\nThe finding that political parties carry out their pledges has stood up to repeated, cross-national study. A rapidly growing field of scholarship is dedicated to investigating the connection between manifesto promises and subsequent government policy, known among experts as the “programme-to-policy linkage”. Researchers search party manifestos for measurable policy pledges and check government actions, legislation and news media sources for evidence of their progress.\nThe most comprehensive study of the programme-to-policy linkage was published in 2017. It brought together 20,000 specific campaign promises from 57 elections in 12 countries. The strongest linkage is found in the United Kingdom, with over 85% of promises by governing parties at least partly enacted in the years studied.\nThere are also patterns in campaign pledge fulfilment, with a substantial difference observed between consensus and majoritarian democracies.\nWe also know that promises are more often fulfilled when a party does not have to share power with others, such as in a coalition government. In political systems like Austria and Italy, where coalition governments are the norm, fewer election promises become government policy. The politics of compromise is built into these democracies but it does mean that governing parties typically fulfil only half of their manifesto pledges.\nPledge fulfilment is also affected by factors like economic growth, coalition negotiations and the previous governing experience of parties.\nThe pledge paradox\nThe take home message from this area of study is that politicians do seem to try to keep their promises. The central mechanism by which vote choices are supposed to translate into policy works more smoothly than voters assume. This disconnect between public beliefs and the academic consensus even has a name, the pledge paradox.\nPA\nWhy are public beliefs out of sync with the evidence? A recent study shows that negativity bias – the tendency for people to react more strongly to negative information – is the reason that voters remember broken pledges better than fulfilled ones. Meanwhile, a new paper of mine, suggests that voters only react to the fulfilment or breakage of promises on issues they care about. Perhaps parties are damned if they do, damned if they don’t.\nHedging about pledging\nBoth political parties and researchers, however, must confront questions about the importance of pledges enacted by parties. A recently completed study of pledges from the 2017 Conservative manifesto shows that the promises considered more important by voters were less likely to be kept. For example a pledge to make maps of school buildings available to parents was kept, while the commitment to reduce net migration to below 100,000 was again broken. An impressive fulfilment rate of 69% declined to 48% when they were weighted by voter priority.\nSeparately, the volunteer-run Policy Tracker project also recently completed its analysis of the same manifesto. The group categorised pledges differently from past researchers, including more subjective statements in the analysis. Using this method, it reports that just 29% of the previous government’s pledges were fulfilled, with a further 55% “in progress” by the time the 2019 election was called.\nAlthough these newer approaches add nuance to our understanding of the linkage, it remains the case that governments make a sincere effort to carry out most promises. It is uncommon for British parties to outright break promises – this happens most often when they are forced to compromise with others or get defeated in parliament. Famous recent examples include the Liberal Democrats’ pledge to abolish tuition fees in 2010 before entering a coalition government with a party that opposed the idea. Then, of course, there was the Conservatives’ failure to pass a Brexit deal after the 2017 election.\nAlthough fulfilling election pledges is not the be-all and end-all of democratic processes, it’s fair to say that the research rebukes the conventional wisdom that campaign promises are worthless. On the contrary, political parties take them very seriously.\nClick here to subscribe to our newsletter if you believe this election should be all about the facts.",
