      "text": "Artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) is the involvement of artificial intelligence technology, such as generative AI chatbots, to create a learning environment.[1] The field combines elements of generative AI, data-driven decision-making, AI ethics, data-privacy and AI literacy.[2] Challenges and ethical concerns of using artificial intelligence in education include bad practices, misinformation, and bias.[3]\nHistory [ edit ]\nAIEd can be traced back as early as in the 1960s, when educators and researchers found the developing possibilities of computers in helping to learn. Computer-based instruction systems made use of program instructions for students to experience interactive learning outcomes. One such example is PLATO, which was developed by University of Illinois for the students.[4] In the years 1970s and 1980s, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) were being adapted to classroom teachings. ITS provided instructions and materials based on performance, representing a customized approach to learning.\nIn November 2022, a chatbot named ChatGPT was released by OpenAI. It rapidly became popular, and its general-purpose capabilities triggered concerns about the potential for cheating. AI content detectors have been developed, although their accuracy was limited. Some schools banned ChatGPT, but many bans were later reverted.[5]\nBackground [ edit ]\nArtificial intelligence could be defined as \"systems which display intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions – with some degree of autonomy – to achieve specific goals\".[6] These systems might be software-based or embedded in hardware.[7] They can rely on machine learning or rule-based algorithms.[8]\nThere is no single lens with which to understand AI in education (AIEd), but the genealogy of education and AI,[9] its promises and problematics[10] may assist with seeing the bigger picture. The Dartmouth workshop is considered a founding event for AI.[11] At least two paradigms have emerged from this workshop. Firstly the tutoring / transmission paradigm, where AIEd systems represent a conduit for personalizing learning. Secondly, the coordination paradigm, where AIEd is the supporter of a cohort's knowledge construction, and this mass is socialized into new systems of thought. Alternately there is the leadership model, where individuals take agency and make choices about their learning (with or without AI)[12][13] AIEd could be viewed as the ultimate disruption, replacing academics and their scholarly prestige,[14] or an opportunity to consider together, what makes humans different from machines.\nEmerging perspectives [ edit ]\nThis complex social, cultural, and material assemblage should be seen in its geo-political context. It is likely that AI systems will be shaped by different policy or economic imperatives which will influence the construction, legitimation and use of this assemblage in an education setting.[15][16] Those who see AI as a conduit for knowledge transmission or construction are comfortable with the idea of machine's reasoning or having hallucinations. While those who are sceptics, recognize the cultivated \"closed-off imaginative spaces\" that big tech has captured, notice how big tech's discourse limits critical thought and discussions about these computational systems.[17]\nThe AI in education community [ edit ]\nThe AI in education community has grown rapidly in the global north, driven by venture capital, big tech, and open educationalists.[18] While some believe AI will improve \"access to expertise\"[19] and revolutionize learning through natural language processing,[20] others focus on enhancing LLM reasoning.[21][22]\nIn the global south, critics argue that AI's data processing and monitoring reinforce neoliberal approaches to education rather than addressing colonialism and inequality.[23][24]\nApplications [ edit ]\nApplications in AIEd can be a wide range of tools that can be used by teacher as well as students for learning outcomes. From primary classrooms to training facilities AI has evolved the way of learning through innovative and engaging delivery techniques.[1]\nAI based tutoring system [ edit ]\nIntelligent tutors or Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) such as SCHOLAR system in the 1970s was use for reciprocal questions being asked between teacher and students. The goal of ITS models was to create an artificial interaction between a student and a teacher.[25] ITS integrated four models the student model which was information about the student's abilities, the teacher model where based on analysis of student's performance strategies and guidance was provided, the domain model (knowledge of students and teacher), the diagnosis model where evaluation was made base on domain model. Although, it improved proficiency in studies, some studies provide negative results and claims of inefficiency than human tutoring were made.[26] ITS is limited, in that, it works better for less-complex learning.[25]\nITS have also been used for accessibility purposes, so if teachers have a large number of students they need to attend to, they can use AI to accommodate for students and their differing needs.[25]\nCustom learning platforms [ edit ]\nPersonalized AI platforms are tailor made for individuals based on their strengths and weakness. The platforms make use of algorithms to predict students patterns and habits based on that they make recommendations to make improvement in their performances. Platforms such as LinkedIn, Duolingo are currently some of the popular companies providing the service. However, there is fair share of criticism as these system based learning platforms might provide isolation and student-teacher interaction may fade. Also, biasness in the train information might lead to misinformation.[27]\nAutomated grading system [ edit ]\nAutomation assessment in grading students helps in saving time for the educator, providing immediate feedback. Systems make use of different rubrics combinations to grade performances. These systems need oversight as there might be scoring biasing.[27]\nGenerative AI [ edit ]\nAI tools such as Open AI's ChatGPT, and Grok (chatbot) fall under the category of generative AI, they provide results based on interactions and are very good in making use of search algorithms to give precise results to the user. However, there are risk involving over-reliance and violating academic integrity.[28][29]\nEthical concerns [ edit ]\nWith the advancement and adoption of AI, there are ethical challenges involved and proactive measure need to addressed to ensure equity and fairness to educators and establishments.[1]\nAccessibility [ edit ]\nEqual access to AI could be one of the areas that comes into consideration. As there may many low incomes and rural areas deprived of the platform use. This might widen the gap in terms of education access. Global efforts should be made to accessibility and train educators in those underprivileged areas.[3][30]\nBias and fairness [ edit ]\nAI agents might be trained on biased data according to different company driven agendas. Bias can come in different forms, some of which include: algorithmic, architectural, and machine-learning bias. There are many different kinds of bias that can be introduced to the AI during the machine-learning process.[31] Common types of bias that occur during the machine learning process are: association bias, language bias, exclusion bias, marginalized bias, and sample bias.[32] Since LLMs were created to produce human-like text, bias can easily, and unintentionally be introduced and reproduced.[31] This might lead to knowledge which is fed to them in form of misinformation. There should be policies and check to maintain such bias practices.[30]\nData privacy [ edit ]\nData privacy is an ethical concern as most of the results are on trained data and it can be misused for various purposes. Additionally, there is a lack of transparency from developers, and compliance laws should make sure of the transparency and data privacy is intact.[25][33]\nPerspectives [ edit ]\nEducator Perspectives [ edit ]\nEducators and school administrations have found AI to be improving the efficiency of work done by a big margin, while some percentage of work force are concerned abut overreliance. Professional development is key to integrating AI effectively to ensue current jobs are not replaced.[34][35]\nStudent Perspectives [ edit ]\nStudents are flexible, with technology such as personalized feedback and self-paced learning, but reliability, privacy, and fairness are concerns.[36][37]\nAlgorithms effects on education [ edit ]\nAI companies that focus on education, are currently preoccupied with generative artificial intelligence (GAI), although data science and data analytics is another popular educational theme. At present, there is little scientific consensus on what AI is or how to classify and sub-categorize AI[38][39] This has not hampered the growth of AI in education systems, which are gathering data and then optimising models.\nAI offers scholars and students automatic assessment and feedback, predictions, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants.[18] The \"generative-AI supply chain\",[40] brings conversational coherence to the classroom, and automates the production of content.[41] Using categorisation, summaries and dialogue, AI \"intelligence\" or \"authority\" is reinforced through anthropomorphism and the Eliza effect.\nFraming education [ edit ]\nEducational technology can be a powerful and effective assistant in a suitable setting. Computer companies are constantly updating their technology products. Some educationalists have suggested that AI might automate procedural knowledge and expertise[42] or even match or surpass human capacities on cognitive tasks. They advocate for the integration of AI across the curriculum and the development of AI Literacy.[43] With higher education facilities finding themselves with an opportunity to create a path for themselves and their students by creating guidelines so that AI can incorporated into their curriculum.[44] Others are more skeptical as AI faces an ethical challenge,[45] where \"fabricated responses\" or \"inaccurate information\", politely referred to as \"hallucinations\"[42] are generated and presented as fact. Some remain curious about societies tendency to put their faith in engineering achievements, and the systems of power and privilege[46] that leads towards deterministic thinking.[47] While others see copyright infringement[48][49][40] or the introduction of harm, division and other social impacts, and advocate resistance to AI.[50]\nTokens, text and hallucinations [ edit ]\nLarge language models (LLMs) take text as input data and then generate output text.[51] Coherent sentences are parroted [52] from billions of words and code that has been web-scraped by AI companies or researchers. LLM are often dependent on a huge text corpus that is extracted, sometimes without permission.[53] LLMs are feats of engineering, that see text as tokens. The relationships between the tokens allow LLMs to predict the next word, and then the next, thus generating a meaningful sentence that has an appearance of thought and interactivity. This massive dataset creates a statistical reasoning machine,[54] that does pattern recognition.[55] The LLM examines the relationships between tokens, generates probable outputs in response to a prompt, and completes a defined task, such as translating, editing, or writing. The output that is presented is a smoothed collection of words,[56] that is normalized and predictable. Translation, summarization, information retrieval, conversational interactions are some of the complex language tasks that machines are expected to handle.[57]\nHowever, the text corpora that LLMs draw on can be problematic, as outputs will reflect their stereotypes or biases of the people or culture whose content has been digitized.[58] The confident, but incorrect outputs are termed \"hallucinations\".[59] These plausible errors are not malfunctions but a consequence of the engineering decisions that inform the large language model.[60] \"Guardrails\" offer to act as validators of the LLM output, prevent these errors, and safeguard accuracy.[61] These metaphorical \"hallucinations\" contribute towards the misconception that AI is conscious, perhaps AI mirages are a better alternative.[62] There are no fixes[63][64] for AI mirages, the \"factually incorrect or nonsensical information that seems plausible\".[65]\nSocio-technical imaginaries [ edit ]\nThe benefits of multilingualism, grammatically correct sentences or statistically probable texts written about any topic or domain are clear to those who can afford software as a service (SaaS). In edtech, there is a recurrent theme, that \"emerging technologies\"[66] will transform education.[67] Whether it be radio, TV, PC computers, the internet, interactive whiteboards, social media, mobile phones or tablets. New technologies generate a socio technical imaginary (STI) that offer's society, a shared narrative[68] and a collective vision for the future.[69] Improvements in natural language processing and computational linguistics have re-enforced assumptions that underlie this \"emerging technology\" STI. AI is not an emerging technology, but an \"arrival technology\"[70] AI appears to understand instructions and can generate human-like responses.[71] Behaving as a companion for many in a lonely and alienated world.[72] While also creating a \"jagged technology frontier\",[73] where AI is both very good and terribly bad at very similar tasks.[70]\nPublic goods vs venture capital [ edit ]\nAt first glance, artificial intelligence in education offers pertinent technical solutions to address future education needs.[18] AI champions envision a future where machine learning and artificial intelligence might be applied in writing, personalization, feedback or course development. The growing popularity of AI, is especially apparent to many who have invested in higher education in the past decade.[18] Critical skeptics on the other hand, are wary of rhetoric that presents technology as solution. They point out that in public services, like education, human and algorithmic decision systems should be approached with caution.[74] Post digital scholars and sociologists are more cautious about any techno-solutions, and have warned about the dangers of building public systems around alchemy,[74] stochastic parrots or cognitive capitalism.[75] They argue that there are multiple costs that accompany LLMs, including dangerous biases the potential for deception, and environmental costs[52] The AI curious are aware of how cognitive activity has become commodified. They see how education has been transformed into a \"knowledge business\" where items are traded, bought, or sold.[76] African hyper scalers, venture capital and vice chancellors[77] are punting the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with the prospect of billions earmarked for South African Data centers,[78] such as Teraco Data Environments, Vantage Data Centre,[38] Africa Data Centres[41] NTT /Dimension_Data,[20] carefully avoiding being accused of monopoly practices.[79]\nAI resilient graduates [ edit ]\nAI has co-existed comfortably between academia and industry for years.[80] The terrain is shifting and currently AI research in the global north has computing power, large datasets, and highly skilled researchers. Power is shifting away from students and academics toward corporations and venture capitalists.[81] Graduates from universities in dominant cultures, where there are high levels of digitisation, need to become AI-resilient. Graduates from the majority world also need to value their own process of knowledge construction, resist the lure of normalisation and see AI for what it is, another form of enclosure, and start blogging.[opinion] Graduates from both the global north and the majority of the world need to be able to critique AI output, become familiar with the processes of technical change,[82] and let their own studies and intellectual life guide their working futures.[41]\nTrust in AI educational technology [ edit ]\nAt present, teachers are still skeptical about AI due to two main factors: lack of knowledge and understanding of AI, as well as some misunderstandings about it. Because AI can only score based on written work, and teachers can sometimes understand what students want to express through text. So, teachers lack trust and have a negative attitude towards the use of AI-Edtech.[83]\nChallenges and criticism [ edit ]\nChallenges involved are mostly about over reliance on the technology could lead to lesser creativity, critical thinking and problem solving abilities especially if students skip traditional methods. Algorithm errors, hallucination are some of the common flaws found today in AI agents, which sometimes makes it unreliable and less trustworthy.[3] The increasing use of artificial intelligence tools by students for academic tasks has raised concerns about the potential adverse effects of widespread reliance on these tools on learning and the development of critical thinking skills. Reliance on generative artificial intelligence, for example, is linked with reduced academic self-esteem and performance, and heightened learned helplessness [84] - raising concerns about its unintended effects. The study also found that use of Generative AI for academic tasks was lower among students with the conscientiousness trait- suggesting that self-disciplined and goal-oriented individuals were less inclined to rely on AI tools in their academic work. These findings further underscore concerns raised in prior studies regarding academic integrity in the context of AI use in academic settings.[85]\nSee also [ edit ]\nGoogle AI Studio — can view your screen and hear your voice [ 86 ]",

      "text": "by Office of Communications, College of Education / Oct 24, 2024\nGenerative AI has opened up a whole new world to administrators, educators, and students. The power of AI is undeniable, and understanding the pros and cons of artificial intelligence in education is essential for making informed decisions. To best use AI in schools, teachers and administrators need to know AI’s advantages and challenges.\nGenerative AI is here to stay, and its impact on the field of education will only grow as artificial intelligence continues to develop. While the specter of students using AI to cheat has raised concerns among educators around the world, the potential positive and productive uses of AI counterbalance those fears.\nIndeed, AI can be used to inspire and foster creativity, lend multiple perspectives, summarize existing materials, generate and reinforce lesson plans, and stimulate image creation. To date, however, student use far exceeds that of instructors: According to a national survey conducted by Tyton Partners in 2023, 27% of students reported being regular users of generative AI tools, as opposed to just 9% of instructors. Nearly half of students have tried AI writing tools at least once; 71% of instructors have never tried AI tools.\nIt’s in educators’ best interests to understand the uses and advantages of AI and to be aware of the challenges of the technology. Armed with this information, educators can make sound decisions about how to implement AI in their classrooms.\nIn the next two sections, we’ll look at the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence in education.\nThe Advantages of AI in Education\nWe have already mentioned some of the advantages of AI in education—inspiring creativity, summarizing existing materials, and so on. This section will delve deeper into the pros and cons of AI in schools, focusing on how these tools can reshape the learning environment. Here’s a brief look at eight more advantages.\nIt can be used to personalize learning. AI can help you tailor your content to individual student needs and learning styles, based on AI-driven analytics that give you insight into student performance and learning trends. In this way, AI helps students be more engaged and motivated.\nIt can provide students with immediate feedback. AI offers students instantaneous and detailed feedback on their work, helping them to see their strengths and weaknesses. Such feedback enhances understanding and learning outcomes—and helps teachers to know what to focus on in future lessons.\nIt can be used to create and supplement content. Through AI-powered platforms, you can create lessons, activities, assessments, discussion prompts, and presentations simply by providing a short prompt with keywords.\nIt can result in more inclusive lessons. AI has powerful tools that make previously inaccessible material available to students with special needs. Tools that offer text-to-speech, visual recognition, speech recognition, and more can help teachers adapt resources so that all students have an equal learning opportunity.\nIt can provide greater access to resources. Educators can access a wealth of AI-powered platforms to facilitate and enhance the learning that takes place in their classrooms. Just a few examples are Canva Magic Write, which helps in brainstorming, outlining, and lesson planning; Curipod, which enables teachers to quickly create interactive lessons; Eduaide, which provides teachers with more than 100 resource types to choose from to create high-quality instructional materials; and Quizzizz, which can be used to design quizzes that will create a personalized learning path based on each student’s responses.\nIt can make abstract concepts more understandable. Image-generating AI tools such as Picsart and Visme can turn complex concepts into more readily accessible content.\nIt can be used to handle administrative tasks. You can use AI to streamline administrative tasks such as grading, scheduling, communicating with parents, and managing student records. This frees you up to do what you do best: teach. It affords you more hands-on time with students and helps to ensure that no students fall through the cracks.\nIt can foster critical thinkers.\nThe advent and growing use of AI in classrooms lends itself to discussions regarding critical thinking and ethical considerations. Students are naturally intrigued by AI. The rich discussions that you can facilitate can help them grow and develop as thinkers and learners.\nThe Challenges and Limitations of AI in Education\nWith all the advantages that AI can offer to teachers, students, and administrators, it does come with its challenges and drawbacks. Following are some of the most common issues that concern educators.\nPrivacy and Security Concerns\nPrivacy risks have been a concern for as long as AI has been around. People are wary about what personal data is collected and how it is used—and whether they have any knowledge of or control over how it is used. Many voice concerns about how carefully their data is stored and how protected it is from being leaked. Other worries include having private and sensitive information viewed by others, having false or misleading information disseminated, and the increasing ease others have in accessing others’ personal data.\nBroadly speaking, risks are involved in data collection, data processing, data dissemination, and invasion (encroaching into an individual’s personal space, choices, or activities).\nPotential Bias in AI Algorithms\nStudies have shown significant bias in GPT (generative pre-trained transformers; e.g., ChatGPT) against non-native English speakers. For example, one study shows over half of non-native English writing samples were misclassified as AI generated (while the accuracy for native English speakers was nearly perfect).\nPart of the problem is that GPT detectors are programmed to recognize language that is more literary and complex as more “human.” Thus, writers not using such language are more likely to be categorized as using AI-generated content and could be unjustly flagged for AI plagiarism. Non-English-speaking students may be falsely accused of cheating, which can undermine their academic career and damage their psyches.\nWhen assessing the use of non-native English speakers, it might be best not to use GPT detectors as assessment tools until the detectors have gone through a more comprehensive evaluation. They can be more safely employed as educational aids, helping students become better writers.\nReduced Human Interaction\nRelying more and more on AI may reduce the teacher-to-student interactions and relationships and take away from the social-emotional aspects of learning. If those interactions diminish, students’ social skills and interpersonal development will suffer. Teachers need to be aware of this and take care to identify and respond to the social and emotional needs of their students.\nHowever, on the flip side, automating administrative tasks such as lesson planning, grading, and maintaining student records should free up teachers’ time to spend more time building relationships with students and fostering their social and emotional growth. Doing so has proven to result in many benefits, including better grades and higher college enrollment rates.\nThat said, a recent survey showed that only 22 percent of students—an all-time low—believe that their teachers try to understand their lives outside of school. Schools can use AI to facilitate the relationships between teachers and students—but they must make an intentional effort to do so. It’s a touchpoint to be aware of and stay on top of.\nHigh Implementation Costs\nThe cost of AI in education can vary greatly, depending on how schools want to use it. Simple generative AI systems that teachers can use in lesson planning can cost as little as $25 a month, but larger adaptive learning systems can run in the tens of thousands of dollars. Implementing these larger systems is likewise very expensive and is beyond the budgets of many schools, including those in underserved communities. And then there’s the ongoing costs of maintaining and updating the systems and training staff to effectively use them.\nAcademic Misconduct\nCheating and plagiarism are, as mentioned, chief among the AI concerns raised by educators. If AI is used to complete assignments or exams or write papers, it is unfair to the students who don’t cheat, and it undermines the education and learning process for those who do cheat. If students learn to cheat and take shortcuts in classrooms, what kind of citizens will they make when they are finished with their education? Measures need to be in place to ensure that AI is not being used unethically.\nUnpredictability and Inaccurate Information\nAI is only as good as the algorithms it is based on. If the data it draws from is inaccurate or biased, then the information it creates will be inaccurate or biased. Students need to learn how to evaluate and think critically about the information they come across and not just accept it at face value. There are many educational resources accessible online to help them do this.\nArtificial Intelligence in Education Pros and Cons\nGenerative AI gives teachers, students, and administrators access to powerful tools that can be put to great use in education. However, understanding the pros and cons of artificial intelligence in education is key to utilizing these tools effectively. Exploring the effects of AI on education, both positive and negative, helps administrators create policies that enhance student learning while minimizing potential drawbacks.\nIt can streamline administrative tasks, free more time for teachers to build relationships and the social and emotional skills of students, tailor students’ learning experiences according to their individual needs and learning styles, and improve accessibility for students with disabilities. It can also help researchers collect and analyze data to enhance curriculum effectiveness and spot areas that need improvement, and it offers a wide range of educational resources and platforms for both students and educators.\nBut it has its downfalls too. Concerns with AI in education include privacy and security issues, bias in algorithms that can affect educational outcomes, the potential to rely too heavily on the technology at the expense of teacher-student interactions, and the costs associated with implementing and maintaining AI technologies in schools. Additionally, it can be used unethically if strong safeguards and monitoring systems aren’t in place, and its information is only as complete and accurately representative as its algorithms.\nEducators and administrators need to weigh the pros and cons of AI in education as they contemplate how they and their students will use the technology. By considering the pros and cons of AI in the classroom, educators can ensure that AI's integration supports meaningful learning experiences.\nShape the Future with a Master's of Education Degree\nKeeping up with all the issues and aspects of AI in education is critical for administrators and educators. Making informed policy decisions about platforms, uses, collection and handling of data, privacy and security, and more are crucial to harnessing the power of AI in effective, intentional, and fair ways. In doing so, you will enhance your students’ learning experiences and open up new worlds to them.\nWe want to help you learn how to best manage these and related issues.

      "text": "Rising seniors are the last class of students who remember high school before ChatGPT. But only just barely: OpenAI’s chatbot was released months into their freshman year. Ever since then, writing essays hasn’t required, well, writing. By the time these students graduate next spring, they will have completed almost four full years of AI high school.\nGone already are the days when using AI to write an essay meant copying and pasting its response verbatim. To evade plagiarism detectors, kids now stitch together output from multiple AI models, or ask chatbots to introduce typos to make the writing appear more human. The original ChatGPT allowed only text prompts. Now students can upload images (“Please do these physics problems for me”) and entire documents (“How should I improve my essay based on this rubric?”). Not all of it is cheating. Kids are using AI for exam prep, generating personalized study guides and practice tests, and to get feedback before submitting assignments. Still, if you are a parent of a high schooler who thinks your child isn’t using a chatbot for homework assistance—be it sanctioned or illicit—think again.\nRead: AI cheating is getting worse\nThe AI takeover of the classroom is just getting started. Plenty of educators are using AI in their own job, even if they may not love that chatbots give students new ways to cheat. On top of the time they spend on actual instruction, teachers are stuck with a lot of administrative work: They design assignments to align with curricular standards, grade worksheets against preset rubrics, and fill out paperwork to support students with extra needs. Nearly a third of K–12 teachers say they used the technology at least weekly last school year. Sally Hubbard, a sixth-grade math-and-science teacher in Sacramento, California, told me that AI saves her an average of five to 10 hours each week by helping her create assignments and supplement curricula. “If I spend all of that time creating, grading, researching,” she said, “then I don’t have as much energy to show up in person and make connections with kids.”\nBeyond ChatGPT and other popular chatbots, educators are turning to AI tools that have been specifically designed for them. Using MagicSchool AI, instructors can upload course material and other relevant documents to generate rubrics, worksheets, and report-card comments. Roughly 2.5 million teachers in the United States currently use the platform: “We have reason to believe that there is a MagicSchool user in every school district in the country,” Adeel Khan, the company’s founder, told me. I tried out the platform for myself: One tool generated a sixth-grade algebra problem about tickets for Taylor Swift’s Eras tour: “If the price increased at a constant rate, what was the slope (rate of change) in dollars per day?” Another, “Teacher Jokes,” was underwhelming. I asked for a joke on the Cold War for 11th graders: “Why did the Cold War never get hot?” the bot wrote. “Because they couldn’t agree on a temperature!”\nSo far, much AI experimentation in the classroom has been small-scale, driven by tech-enthusiastic instructors such as Hubbard. This spring, she fed her course material into an AI tool to produce a short podcast on thermodynamics. Her students then listened as invented hosts discussed the laws of energy transfer. “The AI says something that doesn’t make sense,” she told her students. “See if you can listen for that.” But some school districts are going all in on AI. Miami’s public-school system, the third-largest in the country, initially banned the use of chatbots. Over the past year, the district reversed course, rolling out Google’s Gemini chatbot to high-school classrooms where teachers are now using it to role-play historical figures and provide students with tutoring and instant feedback on assignments. Although AI initiatives at the district level target mostly middle- and high-school students, adults are also bringing the technology to the classrooms of younger children. This past year, Iowa made an AI-powered reading tutor available to all state elementary schools; elsewhere, chatbots are filling in for school-counselor shortages.\nRead: The Gen Z lifestyle subsidy\nMany schools still have bans on AI tools. A recent study on how kids are using AI in 20 states across the South and Midwest found that rural and lower-income students were least likely to say their schools permit AI use. The Houston Independent School District (HISD) offers one case study in what can go wrong when AI enters the classroom. This past school year, the district’s curricula were seemingly tainted with AI slop, according to parents. In February, eighth graders viewed a slideshow depicting AI-generated art mimicking the style of the Harlem Renaissance. According to an op-ed in the Houston Chronicle written by two HISD parents, students were also given error-laden worksheets (one, on transportation technology, depicted a mix between a car and a chariot that was pulled by a horse with three back legs) and inscrutable discussion questions (“What is the exclamation point(s) to something that surprised you,” one asked). An HISD spokesperson told me that the Harlem Renaissance images were indeed AI-generated using Canva, a graphic-design tool; he was unable to confirm whether AI was used in the other examples.\nNone of this is slowing AI’s rollout in schools. This spring, President Donald Trump signed an executive order promoting AI use in the classroom with the goal of training teachers to integrate “AI into all subject areas” so that kids gain an expertise in AI “from an early age.” The White House’s push to incorporate AI in K–12 education has repeatedly emphasized public-private partnerships, a call that tech companies already appear to be embracing. Last month, Microsoft pledged to give more than $4 billion toward advancing AI education across K–12 schools, community and technical colleges, and nonprofits. The same week as Microsoft’s announcement, the American Federation of Teachers, one of the country’s largest teachers unions, announced a $23 million partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic. One of the partnership’s first efforts is a “National Academy for AI Instruction,” opening in New York City this fall, where instructors will learn how to use AI for generating lesson plans and other tasks. The program then plans to expand nationally to reach 10 percent of U.S. teachers over the next five years.\nSchools are stuck in a really confusing place. Everyone seems to agree that education needs an upgrade for the AI era. “Our students right now are going to be put at a disadvantage internationally if we don’t evolve,” Miguel Cardona, Joe Biden’s education secretary, told me. But no one seems to agree on what those changes should look like. Since ChatGPT’s release, the in-class essay, the oral exam, blue-book exams, and even cursive have all made something of a comeback in certain classrooms, in an effort to prevent students from outsourcing all their writing and thinking to AI. At the same time, AI aims to make work more efficient—which is exactly what students are using it for. In that sense, whether kids using AI on their homework counts as cheating is “almost a semantic issue,” argues Alex Kotran, a co-founder of the AI Education Project, a nonprofit focused on AI literacy. Of course, try telling that to a concerned parent.\nAs Kotran points out, a middle ground exists between pretending students aren’t using AI and encouraging them to rely on it nonstop. “Even if you believe that everybody is going to be using AI in the future,” he told me, “it doesn’t necessarily follow that the top priority should be getting students hands-on right away.” Imagine if in 2007, schools had decided that the best way to prepare kids for the future was to force every student to spend all day in front of an iPhone. No matter what teachers’, students’, and parents’ attitudes about AI in the classroom are, though, it’s a reality they have to deal with. The path that schools take from here has direct implications for the future of AI more generally. The more reliant kids are on the technology now, the larger a role AI will play in their lives later. Once schools go all in, there’s no turning back.",

      "text": "Like so many of the technologies that have changed the world, artificial intelligence (AI) developed over many years before it seemed to suddenly burst on the scene. Today, AI is ubiquitous and offers revolutionary potential for education.\nWith AI, educators can tailor learning experiences to individual student needs, making education more effective and engaging. AI-enabled technologies also assist in administrative tasks, streamlining operations and freeing up educators to focus on teaching. Learn more about how teachers and school administrators are using AI-powered tools today and the possibilities for the future of artificial intelligence in education.\nA short history of AI systems development\nThe term \"artificial intelligence\" was actually coined in 1956. In that year, John McCarthy, a Dartmouth College professor, organized a pivotal workshop that coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" and aimed to create machines capable of reasoning and using human language.1\nAfter a fast start, research interest in AI cooled for a few decades before developments in computer technology drove a resurgence in the 1990s with advances in machine learning and neural networks. The public release of Chat GPT in 2022 marked a significant milestone, showcasing unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, and fueling further advancements in AI. Today, AI significantly impacts various sectors, from healthcare to finance, manufacturing, and transportation. Many think it is also poised to revolutionize education.2\nPaving the way for AI tools in education\nComputer-assisted instruction (CAI) began in the 1960s, presenting instructional material with expensive mainframe computers. As computer technology became smaller and more affordable, more schools were able to adopt CAI.\nIntelligent tutoring systems emerged with the advent of desktop computers, offering tutorial programs that provided immediate feedback and tailored learning paths based on student responses. These systems demonstrated the potential benefits of personalized learning, making technology adoption in education increasingly attractive.3\nCurrent applications of AI in education\nAI is transforming K-12 education by offering innovative solutions in personalized learning, adaptive learning platforms, intelligent tutoring systems, automated grading and feedback, and administrative tasks.\nPersonalized learning\nAI in education facilitates individualized learning by tailoring instructional content to individual student needs, benefiting students, teachers, and resource-constrained schools. This approach allows students to progress at their own pace, engage with activities aligned with their learning styles, and gain more autonomy over their educational journeys. Using AI assistants to differentiate assignments and devise data-driven, adaptive practices enhances the overall learning experience with minimal increase to the teacher's workload.4\nIntelligent tutoring systems\nAI tutor systems can provide adaptive, accessible learning experiences, offering immediate feedback and corrective guidance based on student performance. These applications of modern educational technology are helping to close learning gaps, improve conceptual understanding, and free up teacher time by handling routine instructional tasks and providing detailed data on the student's learning process.5, 6\nAutomated grading and feedback\nTraditional grading for written work often involves subjectivity and biases, as teachers’ evaluations can be influenced by personal preferences, moods, and unconscious prejudices. This lack of objectivity can result in inconsistent and unfair assessments. Additionally, the time-consuming nature of grading large numbers of assignments limits teachers' capacity to provide thorough feedback, potentially hindering student learning.7\nIntegrating AI into the grading process is revolutionizing traditional approaches to evaluating student performance. AI can enhance grading efficiency, precision, and fairness by significantly reducing grading time and providing instant, detailed feedback. This allows teachers to assign more writing tasks and offer timely, constructive feedback, which fosters better writing skills in students.7\nHowever, it's essential that teachers critically review AI-generated feedback to ensure it aligns with educational goals and addresses individual student needs. AI tools should be seen as assistants rather than replacements, helping teachers focus on assessing creativity and critical thinking while AI assists teachers with more objective metrics like grammar and structure. By staying engaged in the grading process and spot-checking AI output, teachers can maintain the integrity of assessments and ensure students receive meaningful and accurate feedback.8, 9\nAdministrative applications\nArtificial intelligence tools can streamline lesson planning and content creation, saving teachers valuable time. These AI tools can generate high-quality images, customized content, and focused research materials under tight time constraints. By using AI for efficient research and content generation, teachers can enhance lesson quality without increasing their workload, ultimately benefiting both students and resource-constrained schools.10\nSchool principals can also leverage AI technologies to reduce their substantial administrative burdens. AI chatbots assist with automating administrative tasks such as drafting emails, organizing schedules, and developing professional development sessions. AI models can be used to analyze large datasets to inform decision-making, like scheduling summer classes based on parent preferences. This allows administrators to focus more on strategic initiatives, human interaction and relationship-building.11\nSome ways teachers are using generative AI tools\nTeachers are finding many different ways to use AI capabilities to enhance learning outcomes. Two notable applications include creating visual aids for vocabulary instruction and planning engaging math lessons.\nSupport for vocabulary instruction\nAn instructional designer has helped teachers create visuals for many different grade levels and subjects using AI. Her tips for doing so include:12\nIdentify challenging vocabulary words for upcoming lessons\nChoose an AI tool that fits your needs and is easy to access\nCraft specific prompts to generate images that illustrate vocabulary words\nShare and credit the AI-generated images with students to introduce the concept of AI\nMath lesson planning using artificial intelligence\nThe author, a high school math teacher and instructional coach, explains how to use generative AI to assist teachers in planning engaging math lessons. Her steps include:13\nUse AI to connect math topics to real-world applications and student interests\nGenerate word problems, performance tasks, and projects that align with curriculum standards\nDesign comprehensive lesson plans with essential questions, practice problems, and extension opportunities\nUse AI to create inquiry-based activities that develop critical thinking and quantitative literacy skills\nFor more ideas from teachers, visit Edutopia.org or search online using your favorite AI-enabled search tool.\nAI-driven learning\nAI applications in education can foster interactive collaboration and facilitate content creation and curation for students and teachers alike. These tools help teachers develop content aligned with curriculum standards, ensuring that educational materials effectively meet diverse student needs. Interactive tools like virtual labs and educational games engage students, while collaborative platforms facilitate peer learning. Teachers can use these technologies and the data-driven insights they provide to personalize learning paths and offer adaptive feedback, enhancing the overall learning experience.\nThe future of AI in education\nThe widespread adoption of AI in the last few years, including its growing use in schools, has caused reactions ranging from outright banning to enthusiastic embrace. Because the tools will continue to evolve and change the way we operate in all areas of life, teachers and educational administrators need to come to terms with several ethical considerations about AI in education.\nConcerns about privacy, bias, and equity\nPrivacy is one major concern with artificial intelligence in education. AI tools often collect and process large amounts of data, raising questions about how this data is used and protected. To address this, educators should ensure transparency by informing students and parents about the data collected and seeking consent before using AI tools.14\nBias in AI is another significant issue, as AI systems can inherit biases from their training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Educators should be aware of these biases and seek to use AI tools that have been rigorously tested for fairness. Additionally, incorporating diverse perspectives in AI development and regularly spot-checking for bias can help mitigate problems.15\nEquity concerns arise when considering access to AI tools. Not all students have equal access to technology, which can widen the digital divide. Schools should strive to provide equitable access to AI resources and offer training for both students and teachers to ensure everyone can benefit from these tools.14\nConcerns about student use of AI\nTeachers worry about students using AI technology to bypass learning, such as using it to complete assignments. One way to address this is by designing assignments that require personal engagement and critical thinking, which are harder for AI technologies to replicate.9\nTeaching AI literacy is crucial. Students should understand AI's capabilities and limitations, including the potential for AI systems to generate biased or inaccurate content. Encouraging students to leverage AI tools for learning rather than shortcut assignments will help maintain academic integrity.15\nBy considering these concerns and implementing thoughtful strategies, educators and administrators can harness AI's benefits while addressing its potential drawbacks.\nAI technology implementation challenges and best practices\nResistance to change, high costs, and infrastructure needs are key challenges in implementing AI in education. Best practices for implementing artificial intelligence in education are similar to those for integrating any education technology. They include providing thorough training for educators, ensuring equitable access to AI tools, addressing ethical concerns, and maintaining open communication with all stakeholders to foster a supportive and informed community.\nConfidently meet the future of AI in education with the University of Iowa\nAI in education offers transformative potential by personalizing learning, streamlining administrative tasks, and enhancing instructional quality.

      "text": "Recent news headlines of students using generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT to write term papers may be what comes to mind for some when thinking about how AI is being introduced in classrooms. But it isn’t the only story to tell about AI in education – or education on AI.\nAI is transforming how students learn to engage with the world around them and use new technologies to create solutions to real problems.\nResearchers in California have developed an award-winning online game to teach high school students university-level AI and computational thinking concepts. Another team of researchers in California are using AI to teach AI with activities facilitated by a virtual human AI avatar meant to engage young children and their families in learning about AI concepts. On the other side of the country, middle school students in Maine starting their fall semester will soon look at the capabilities of an AI bird feeder that will be placed in their schoolyard before diving into AI or historical data set projects about puffins living off the coast of Maine.\nThese are only three projects among many that have received grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation in the last several years, and the number grows larger by the day.\nNSF leadership in AI for education\n“For more than 30 years, NSF has both led and invested in AI research projects to support, reimagine, and transform learning and teaching with the use of emerging technologies,” says James L. Moore III, NSF assistant director for STEM education. “Through NSF-funded research, we are learning how to harness AI to make education more equitable, inclusive, and accessible.” These research projects include helping the nation understand what AI means for the future of education, how it can benefit classrooms, including students, teachers, and parents, and what methods are best to inspire, engage, and teach future generations about AI.\n“NSF has been leading the AI frontier, not chasing it,” said Chia Shen, a program officer in NSF’s Directorate for STEM Education. “We have a rich portfolio in this area with a strong impact. This is part of how we as an agency help the nation and the issues we have with AI like ethical issues, and biases; it’s not just about ChatGPT.”\nCredit: AI4K12 (CC BY NC SA 4.0) Five Big Ideas in Artificial Intelligence for the AI for K-12 audience.\nIn fact, in 2019, an NSF-funded project led to the development of national guidelines for teaching and learning about AI in K-12 school settings. Prior to this, there were few to no curriculums in the U.S. dedicated to teaching young, pre-college students about the fundamental knowledge and skills related to AI. Now educators and curriculum developers can visit the AI for K-12 initiative website to find guidelines. Teachers can use these to develop instructional experiences in AI for their students to better prepare them for the rapidly growing field.\nInteractive AI exhibits\nNSF-funded resources can also introduce younger learners to AI. Researchers at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies and the University of California, Berkeley, Lawrence Hall of Science are designing an interactive AI exhibit tailored to elementary-aged children. AI concepts are generally taught in college and graduate level courses, so researchers had to come up with new, accessible ways for children to engage with the exhibit effectively.\nThe researchers also had to keep in mind that children often have shorter attention spans and must be presented with new information in quick, easily digestible lessons. With that in mind, the research team developed several interactives that break down complex AI concepts into a series of more digestible activities. The activities include small games wherein a child is asked to help the virtual human AI avatar perceive, learn, reason and plan. For example, children can interact with a virtual human that tries to interpret which facial expressions they are making. Children can also guide a virtual human avatar through the task of cleaning up a cafeteria by identifying specific steps it needs to take.\nIn addition to conveying these complex concepts, researchers also want to spark curiosity about how AI works.\nFrom the exhibit, researchers also discovered a few unexpected things. Ari Krakowski, director of the Center for Transforming Science and Society, noticed museum visitors and their families getting excited about the human aspect of AI. When children were engaging with the activity wherein the virtual human AI avatar is meant to determine what facial expression the visitor is making, parents and older siblings began to get involved as well and learn together through the experience.\n“There was this joy and interconnectedness in the room,” said Krakowski.\nGames that teach AI concepts\nNing Wang, a research associate professor at USC who worked on the \"Virtual Human\" exhibit, worked on another NSF project that began with a desire to teach AI concepts to younger audiences through a gaming platform. This ended up having more profound impacts than she initially planned.\nThe game, ARIN-561, provides players with the opportunity to explore a strange new planet as a crash-landed astronaut. Through a well-paced tutorial and AI transfer module, players begin the game by learning about common methods used in AI called classical search algorithms by testing different possible routes to save their wayward robot friend.\nBefore making the game widely available, students across the country were able to test it alongside other educational games to pick a winner of the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, and Education Conference Student’s Choice Award. In that process, the research team learned that two students who were recent refugees from Ukraine had taken the game home and began using it to learn English. Because the students were previously familiar with the topic, they could learn the language through the dialogue of the game and then talk about the shared experience with their classmates. “I don’t know if we could have wished for a better response from the students,” Wang said.\nAI helping students connect with local environments\nAI in education doesn't just help students improve computational thinking skills in the classroom. It can also create new ways to connect learners with their local environments, allow them to think critically about ecological problems, and aid them in coming up with realistic solutions.\nThis fall, middle school students in Maine will use an AI bird feeder set up in their schoolyard to learn how the machine captures, transmits and identifies images of birds that stop by for a visit. For example, they will learn how often the AI correctly identifies each bird and what leads to incorrect identifications. From there, students will be able to jump from birds at their school to the puffins captured on cameras placed on islands off the coast of Maine. Researchers watching those cameras realized that they couldn’t observe the puffin burrows 24/7, but, with the help of AI, they could capture significantly more data and images of the birds and their babies.\nStudents won’t be able to interact with the cameras and its AI capabilities just yet, but Penny Noyce, a science education leader and principal researcher on the project, said, “It will be interesting to see if some of the kids latch onto either birding or AI as a result of this. Birding is a way that non-scientists remain involved in science throughout their lives.”\nIt is easy to see from these examples that the interaction between AI and education goes far beyond how students might use ChatGPT. AI allows students at all grade levels to interact with the world around them, learn about themselves and other people and explore STEM in new ways. NSF is dedicated to continuing to fund projects researching the impact and possibilities of AI inside and outside of the classroom.",

From personalized learning experiences to the automation of administrative tasks, AI promises to not only improve the quality of education but also make it more accessible and equitable.\nThis article explores how AI is transforming education, shaping the future of learning, and the challenges and opportunities it presents for students, teachers, and educational institutions.\nThe Evolution of Education: From Traditional Classrooms to AI-Enhanced Learning\nHistorically, education has always been a manual process. Teachers were responsible for delivering lessons, assessing student progress, and managing classroom environments. However, the rise of digital technology paved the way for online learning platforms, digital classrooms, and massive open online courses (MOOCs), all of which made learning more accessible. But the next leap, the integration of AI, promises to take these advances to an entirely new level.\nThe shift from traditional to AI-powered education isn’t just about digital tools. It’s about creating a learning environment that is more responsive, adaptive, and efficient. The classroom of the future, powered by AI, will be one where students receive personalized learning experiences, teachers become more facilitators than lecturers, and administrative tasks are handled by smart systems.\nPersonalized Learning: Tailoring Education to Individual Needs\nOne of the most exciting aspects of AI in education is its ability to deliver personalized learning experiences. Every student has a unique learning style, pace, and set of strengths and weaknesses. Traditional education systems often struggle to meet these individual needs due to class size, limited resources, and the one-size-fits-all approach. AI has the potential to change that.\nWith AI-driven learning platforms, students can work through material at their own pace. For example, platforms like Coursera, Khan Academy, and Duolingo use AI to analyze a student’s progress and offer tailored content, quizzes, and exercises. By tracking performance data in real-time, AI can provide feedback and adapt lessons to suit the learner’s level of understanding. For struggling students, it can offer more foundational materials, while for advanced learners, it can provide more challenging tasks.\nAdditionally, AI can detect patterns in students’ learning behavior, helping identify areas where they may be struggling or excelling. This allows for a deeper understanding of each student’s learning journey and can guide interventions before issues become more significant.\nAI as a Teaching Assistant: Supporting Educators\nWhile AI is often seen as a tool for students, its impact on teachers is equally transformative. Teachers are often overwhelmed by administrative tasks such as grading, lesson planning, and tracking student progress. AI can ease this burden by automating many of these tasks, freeing up valuable time for teachers to focus on student engagement and instruction.\nFor example, AI tools can grade assignments, exams, and quizzes in a fraction of the time it would take a human educator. This is especially valuable for large classes where individual grading might take days or even weeks. Furthermore, AI can assist teachers in lesson planning by analyzing vast amounts of educational content and suggesting resources that are most aligned with student learning needs.\nBeyond automation, AI-powered virtual assistants can provide teachers with valuable insights into their students’ progress and areas for improvement. By analyzing student data, AI tools can help educators better understand how to adjust their teaching methods to meet the diverse needs of their classroom.\nBridging the Gap: AI for Inclusive and Accessible Learning\nAI has the potential to make education more inclusive, providing opportunities for students who may have otherwise been left behind due to language barriers, disabilities, or socio-economic challenges. AI-powered tools are increasingly being developed to support students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and autism. For example, speech-to-text technologies, like those integrated into platforms such as Google Classroom and Microsoft Word, help students who struggle with writing or reading.\nFurthermore, AI tools are improving accessibility for students who are visually or hearing impaired. Text-to-speech, real-time translation, and sign language recognition technologies can break down barriers for students who face challenges in traditional educational environments. AI-enabled personalized learning apps can also adjust content delivery based on the student’s specific learning preferences and needs.\nIn terms of language learning, AI-powered translation tools are making cross-language communication easier than ever before. Platforms like Google Translate and AI chatbots can help students and teachers overcome language barriers in real time, making education more global and connected.\nAI in Assessment and Feedback: More Than Just Grades\nTraditional assessments like exams and essays have always been the primary method for evaluating students’ progress. However, these methods often fail to capture the full scope of a student’s capabilities and learning journey. AI is introducing new, more dynamic ways to assess and provide feedback.\nAI-driven systems can offer continuous, real-time assessment, providing students with instant feedback on their performance. These systems can also evaluate soft skills such as problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration, which traditional assessments often overlook. For example, AI tools can track how students interact with peers in group projects, analyzing their communication and teamwork abilities.\nMoreover, AI can help teachers give more personalized feedback. Rather than simply providing a score, AI can generate detailed reports that highlight areas where the student excels and areas that need improvement. This kind of data-driven feedback can guide both teachers and students in making adjustments to learning strategies and goals.\nThe Role of Data in Shaping Education\nAI’s ability to analyze vast amounts of data is one of its greatest strengths. In the context of education, this means AI can provide insights not only on individual student performance but also on trends and patterns within entire schools or educational systems. By analyzing data, AI can identify areas where students are consistently struggling, helping educators adapt their teaching methods or curriculum.\nFor instance, if a particular topic is proving difficult for a significant portion of the class, AI can alert teachers to the need for a different teaching approach or additional resources. Schools can also use data-driven insights to make administrative decisions, such as adjusting class schedules, allocating resources, and designing more effective curricula.\nMoreover, AI can help educational institutions track student outcomes over time, providing a comprehensive picture of how students are progressing and whether interventions are successful.\nThe Challenges and Ethical Considerations of AI in Education\nDespite the immense potential of AI, its implementation in education comes with its own set of challenges and ethical considerations. One of the primary concerns is data privacy. AI systems rely on collecting large amounts of data to function effectively, raising concerns about the security and ethical use of student data. Educational institutions must ensure that data is handled responsibly, with strict protocols in place to protect students’ privacy.\nAnother challenge is the digital divide. While AI has the potential to make education more accessible, its benefits may be limited for students in underserved areas who lack access to technology or the internet. Addressing this gap is crucial to ensuring that AI in education does not exacerbate existing inequalities.\nFurthermore, there are concerns about the potential for AI to replace human teachers. While AI can assist with administrative tasks and provide personalized learning experiences, human educators bring empathy, creativity, and critical thinking to the classroom—qualities that AI cannot replicate. The key is to use AI as a tool to enhance, not replace, human teaching.\nThe Future of AI in Education: What Lies Ahead?\nLooking ahead, AI’s role in education will continue to expand and evolve. As technology advances, we can expect AI to become even more integrated into learning platforms, making education more interactive, immersive, and personalized. Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) powered by AI could provide students with fully immersive learning experiences, from exploring historical sites to conducting complex scientific experiments.\nAI could also lead to the development of “smart schools” where every aspect of the educational experience is personalized and optimized for each student. From curriculum to classroom environment, AI could tailor every element to suit the needs and preferences of the individual, making learning more engaging and effective.\nMoreover, the continued integration of AI could lead to new types of careers and educational paths. As automation becomes more prevalent, students will need to develop skills in areas such as AI programming, data science, and robotics, which will require a shift in how educational systems prepare students for the future workforce.\nConclusion: Embracing the AI-Powered Classroom\nIn conclusion, AI is undoubtedly shaping the future of education. Its ability to personalize learning, support teachers, improve accessibility, and provide data-driven insights makes it a powerful tool in the modern classroom. While there are challenges to overcome, including issues related to data privacy and digital equity, the potential benefits of AI in education are immense.\nAs AI continues to evolve, it promises to create a more inclusive, engaging, and efficient education system that prepares students for the future in ways we never thought possible.

It also helps teachers to have an eye for the student who needs extra help.\nLearning Management Systems Tool (Image Source moodle.com)\nA platform like Moodle recommends detailed videos, quizzes, or notes based on what the student has already studied and gone through. For instance, if a student is weak in history, the platform might suggest some extra history lessons or practice tests.\nc. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools\nWith the help of NLP tools that analyze grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, students can hone their writing and communication skills.\nImage showing how grammarly tool help us to improve grammar (Image Source Grammarly.com)\nFor example, a tool like Grammarly helps students write essays or emails. Grammarly gives them tips to make writing clearer and more professional.\nd. Automated Assessment Tools\nTools like these make the process of grading faster and fairer. It gives them the ease not just to check out multiple-choice answers but also essays and written assignments.\nImage showing demo course of automated assessment tool (Image Source Gradescope.com)\nFor instance, a tool like Gradescope helps teachers grade a class test by evaluating the answers, highlighting common mistakes, and showing where students need improvement. This saves teacher time and gives students faster feedback.\ne. Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) with AI\nHaving a combination of AI with VR or AR creates exciting learning experiences. It helps students understand topics by making it more realistic and interactive.\nFor example, with a platform like Nearpod, students can explore ancient Egyptian pyramids as if they are there. In biology, they might use VR to see a 3D human heart and learn how it works by “walking” through it.\nf. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants\nSince these are always online, and immediately accessible, they respond instantly and aid in their comprehension.\nFor example, a student utilises a chatbot such as ChatGPT to study for an exam. They ask, “What’s the formula for speed?” The chatbot instantly replies, “Speed = Distance ÷ Time.”\nMerits & Demerits of Artificial Intelligence in Children\nMerits:\nPersonalised Learning: By adapting training to each student’s needs, AI improves engagement and memory of knowledge.\nSkill Development: Platforms encourage creativity, logical reasoning, and problem-solving through gamified learning experiences.\nAccessibility: AI provides text-to-speech assistance, adaptive tools, and real-time translation capabilities that eliminate barriers between students with and without disabilities.\nContinuous Feedback: AI enables prompt remedial actions and provides immediate feedback on students’ performance.\nGlobal Exposure: With the availability of information and material from all around the globe, they can develop a more extensive view.\nDemerits:\nOver-reliance on AI: Students may become less creative and capable of original thought if they rely too heavily on AI for all of their answers.\nData Privacy Issues: A lot of AI systems gather and keep a lot of personal information, which raises significant security and abuse concerns.\nDecreased Social Interaction: As face-to-face contact declines, an over-reliance on AI may hinder the growth of interpersonal skills.\nEconomic Inequality: A digital divide and increased inequality could arise from the fact that not everyone can purchase AI equipment.\nFuture of AI in Education\nThe future of AI in education is very intriguing, with limitless possibilities:\nFigure 1 Image showing how AI is helping students in education system (image source horizoneducational.com)\nHyper-Personalized Learning: AI will allow the curriculum to change dynamically with the demands of each student to improve effectiveness and happiness in learning.\nFor example, imagine a student who struggles with math but loves learning through videos and visuals. With hyper-personalized learning, AI can adjust the curriculum to provide simpler, interactive math exercises and offer video-based lessons tailored to their preferences. This keeps the student engaged, helps them understand better, and ensures steady progress in their learning.\nGlobal Cooperation: AI-based ed-tech platforms would allow students the opportunity to receive education across geographical borders and have a chance to learn from diversified cultures and perspectives.\nReal-Time Analytics: To ensure better results, schools will use AI analytics to anticipate and correct learning difficulties before they become more serious.\nDespite the many challenges ahead, the future of AI technology promises a future where education is more inclusive, effective, and relevant to real-world challenges and demands.\nHow Can AI Help Parents & Children?\nParents:\nReceive regular, detailed updates on their child’s progress and areas of improvement.\nImage showing how AI supports parents to get weekly updates from school (Image Source Freepik)\nFor instance, a parent uses an AI app that sends weekly updates on their child’s progress, highlighting strengths and areas of struggle, like fractions, and suggesting resources to help improve. This keeps the parent informed and involved.\nChildren:\nEnjoy a personalized learning experience that matches their pace and style.\nAccess on-demand support for queries and assignments, fostering independent learning.\nOvercome barriers of language or disabilities with the help of adaptive tools. Some of the types of disabilities include:\nVisual impairments: Tools like screen readers or voice commands enable learning without relying on sight.\nHearing impairments: AI-powered captioning and sign language tools make lessons accessible.\nLearning disabilities (e.g., dyslexia): Reading assistants can highlight text and provide audio support to aid comprehension.\nPhysical disabilities: Speech-to-text tools help children who cannot write or type.\nAI will benefit parents who are always concerned about their children’s social lives. AI technology allows them to monitor their child’s interaction online more closely than ever before. Schools use software that analyses data points such as how well different students comprehend the material and then groups kids accordingly based on what they need.\nAI makes it possible to access teachers and lessons at any time, from any location. AI algorithms could be used to provide unique assignments, tests, and assessment-related feedback for students. As such, AI would be an effective teaching tool that can help bridge the gap between students in the achievement of their goals. To be better equipped with the challenges this future may face, the School of Scholars will invite promise into the classroom in the guise of this increasingly prevalent technology.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n1.

      "text": "In 1940, the translator and educator AJ Jenkins organised a survey of theÂ reading habits of working-class children. The study, mostly of students who would leave school to enter the workforce at 14, looked atÂ what they had read outside the school curriculum in the previous month. Jenkins worried that boys, especially, read too little, and then only detective novels or adventure stories. Yet from the perspective ofÂ the 21st century, what stands out is the depth of their reading ofÂ classic works.\nAmong the books the children had read in the previous month were The Pilgrimâs Progress, Gulliverâs Travels, Jane Eyre, The Pickwick Papers and The Mill on the Floss. Boys had managed four to six books, girls one or two more than that.\nNewsletters Sign up to hear the latest from The Observer Every Weekday Daily Sensemaker Clear, calm analysis on the stories driving the dayâs news Every Weekday The Observer Daily The very best of our journalism, reviews and ideas â curated each day Weekly Food Weekly A dispatch from The Observerâs kitchen table â from Nigel Slaterâs recipes to interviews, features and hot tips For information about how The Observer protects your data, read our Privacy Policy.\nIt is a list, and an appetite for reading, that might challenge many today. Surveys suggest that both children and adults read less than they used to, and find less enjoyment doing so. Even university students seem to struggle. The Oxford professor Jonathan Bate claimed last year that where once students could read three books aÂ week, today they toil to complete one in three weeks. Others have suggested that students find it difficult to read whole books â aÂ perception that is echoed on the other side of the Atlantic, too.\nTurning universities into businesses has driven many to the brink of bankruptcy\nSuch claims are often contested, and there is sometimes a whiff ofÂ a moral panic. Nevertheless, the contrast with reading habits of aÂ century ago â particularly among workers â is again striking.\nâI sat there on my toolbox, half a mile from the surface,â wrote the Nottinghamshire miner GAWÂ Tomlinson in his autobiography Coal-Miner, âoneÂ mile from the nearest church, and seemingly hundreds of miles from God, reading The Canterbury Tales, LambâsÂ Essays,Â Darwinâs Origin ofÂ Species, WildeâsÂ The Ballad ofÂ Reading Gaol, or anything I could manage to get hold of.â\nOnce, he was so absorbed in Oliver GoldsmithâsÂ poem The Deserted VillageÂ that he allowed tubs full of coal to crash into empties.\nTomlinson was not alone in his obsession with learning. In his classic The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes, JonathanÂ Rose unearths the hidden histories of workers from Lanarkshire to south Wales, and their battles to educate themselves, to create their own libraries and colleges and to enter a cultural world denied to them by the fractures of class and schooling.\nThe pleasure of knowledge transformed, in the words of Cynon Valley minerÂ Robert Morgan, who later became a poet and printmaker, âcolliers doing menial and dangerous jobs inÂ the bowels ofÂ the earthâ into âprivileged human beings exposed to something extraordinaryâ.\nThat working-class tradition, and the sense of the preciousness ofÂ learning that it embodied, may have eroded, but understanding it helps illuminate not just the past but the present, too.\nConsider, for instance, the current debate about the impact of AI on habits of reading and thinking. Most university students now use generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, mainly for research. There is, though, increasing concern about the opportunities to cheat â for students to pass off AI-generated text as their own in assignments and essays. Many people worry, too, about the impact on human cognitive skills and on our aptitude for creativity and critical thinking.\nAs with all powerful new tools, AI has the capacity to both enhance and degrade our lives. It isÂ important for university authorities to think about how toÂ preserve academic integrity, and to rethink how students could be examined. In much of the debate, though, the problem is viewed through the wrong end of the telescope. It is lessÂ that AI is the cause of degradation in reading andÂ thinking, and more that the creation of a culture that views knowledge primarily in an instrumental manner has made it easier to misuse AI.\nIn 1963, the Robbins report into British higher education argued for expansion of universities on the grounds that learning was a good in itself. âThe search for truthâ, the report insisted, âis an essential function of the institutions of higherÂ educationâ.\nIf knowledge is merely a commodity, why not cheat to bypass the need to think?\nHalf a century later came the Browne report on the funding of higher education, published in 2010. Its tone was very different. âHigher education matters,â it insisted, because it allows studentsÂ to gain âhigher wages andÂ better job satisfactionâ, making it âeasier toÂ move from one job to the nextâ, and helping to âproduce economicÂ growthâ.\nThe core message, the historian and critic Stefan Collini observed, was that âwe should no longer think ofÂ higher education as the provision of a public goodâ but rather as aÂ âregulated market in which consumer demand, in the form ofÂ student choice, is sovereign.â\nTurning universities into businesses has driven many to the edge of bankruptcy and led them toÂ cut subjects deemed insufficiently âcommercialâ, including history, music, classics and literature.\nGiven all this, is it surprising that many look upon AI as a tool not to aid thinking but to replace it? After all, if knowledge is merely aÂ commodity, the purchasing ofÂ which allows one to pass an exam or land a job, why should it matter if we cheat or use AI to bypass the need to think?\nUntil we recognise that the debate about AI is not just about what machines can do but also about how humans should value education and knowledge, it will remain mired in confusion. That is why the stories of people such as Tomlinson and Morgan, and their recognition of the human value of knowledge, remain significant today.",

      "text": "Artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing technology that is actively changing how we teach, learn, work, and live. AI can be found nearly everywhere. Many people knowingly and unknowingly interact with AI daily, from mobile phones and computer applications to surveillance systems and media streaming services. In its most basic definition, artificial intelligence is any machine-based system designed around human-defined objectives to perform tasks that would otherwise require human or animal intelligence. Varying in purpose and programming, AI systems can do one or more of the following: identify patterns, understand natural language, produce content, make predictions and decisions, give recommendations, solve problems, or adapt to and learn from new information and circumstances.\nIn general, current artificial intelligence tools can be broken down into three categories:\nReactive AI tools respond to specific inputs or situations without learning from past experiences—for example, AI assistants, such as Alexa and Siri, or household tools, such as Roomba vacuums.\ntools respond to specific inputs or situations without learning from past experiences—for example, AI assistants, such as Alexa and Siri, or household tools, such as Roomba vacuums. Predictive AI tools analyze historical data and experiences to predict future events or behaviors, such as when Amazon or Netflix shows you suggested items.\ntools analyze historical data and experiences to predict future events or behaviors, such as when Amazon or Netflix shows you suggested items. Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, generate novel text, images, videos, or other content based on existing data patterns and structures.\nWhile generative AI has received the greatest attention in recent months, it is important to realize that humans have been using reactive and predictive AI tools for quite some time. In addition, AI technology is developing very quickly, with new models and tools introduced frequently.\nArtificial intelligence employed in pre-K–12 and higher education contexts can take on a variety of forms. A report by Education International provides a helpful construct for these uses:\nStudent-Focused AI includes adaptive tutoring systems, automatic writing evaluation systems, and chatbots, among other tools aimed at supporting students.\nincludes adaptive tutoring systems, automatic writing evaluation systems, and chatbots, among other tools aimed at supporting students. Teacher-Focused AI tools are aimed at teachers and include assessment supports, lesson planning tools, and resource curation systems.\ntools are aimed at teachers and include assessment supports, lesson planning tools, and resource curation systems. Institution-Focused AI helps with school and campus administration and operations, such as handling scheduling, scanning for safety concerns, and identifying students at risk.\nA fourth type, system-focused AI, has also begun to emerge, with some states using AI to determine school funding or score state assessments.\nRecognizing this power, capability, and financial opportunity, technology companies and developers are actively finding ways to integrate AI into education systems worldwide. Yet, at this point, many uses of AI in education are largely speculative, without a strong, independent research base showing that these tools are more effective than existing practices or technologies.\nNonetheless, students and educators have started to embrace artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI. A 2024 report by the Center for Democracy & Technology found that the percentage of K–12 teachers who reported using a generative AI tool for personal or school use jumped 32 percentage points, to 83 percent, between the 2022–2023 school year and 2023–2024. In the same study, 59 percent of teachers reported that they are certain at least one of their students has used generative AI for school purposes. In higher education, 49 percent of students reported using generative AI regularly as of September 2023, although only 22 percent of faculty reported this level of usage.\nThis surge in artificial intelligence, and particularly in generative AI, requires that educators become prepared to assess when it is appropriate to use AI, help their students become AI literate, and advocate for the development of policies about this technology. In other words, educators must be able to not only teach with AI but also teach about AI. Yet, opportunities for educators to get up to speed are still lacking. In a survey taken earlier this year, Education Week found that 71 percent of K–12 teachers had received no professional learning about using artificial intelligence in the classroom.\nAs of this writing, only 16 states—Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia—have issued guidance from the state department of education or another organization. Meanwhile, Tennessee has mandated that districts develop their own policies. New York has issued a statewide ban on the use of facial recognition in education settings. Districts and higher educational institutions have also varied greatly in their approaches, with some banning AI outright (although, some of those bans have since been lifted), some putting policies in place about appropriate use, and some, like the Los Angeles Unified School District, building AI-powered platforms. Education systems are clearly in a transitional phase in terms of determining when and how to harness AI.\nNavigating this significant technological shift will require intense attention and involvement by the NEA, its state and local affiliates, and its members. Members and affiliates need to be prepared to be leaders at their schools and campuses and in policy discussions at all levels of the education system. The needs of students and educators must be at the forefront during the development, selection, implementation, and evaluation of AI technologies to ensure that these tools support effective teaching and learning, not the agendas of for-profit entities or those who would like to undermine public education by replacing school staff with computers. We must also be ready to hold AI developers accountable to protect data privacy and intellectual property rights, mitigate algorithmic bias and inaccurate or nonsensical outputs, and diminish environmental hazards.\nThis report provides background to the proposed Policy Statement on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Education by providing an overview of the promise of AI in education, reviewing existing NEA policies, and providing background research and information on each of the five principles to support the safe, effective, and equitable use of AI technologies in schools and on campuses. The Task Force acknowledges that AI is developing and changing at a rapid pace, and thus, policies must be adaptable and reviewed regularly. Our goal for the Policy Statement and this accompanying report is to provide a starting point for an ongoing conversation about how artificial intelligence should and will become a part of education and society.",

      "text": "This is a great preview of the dangers a lack of privacy can mean for people. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I really need to get this rant off my chest.\nRight now, schools are using AI to monitor students' use of school resources: computers, tablets, cloud storage, message boards, chats, etc.. As a result, things like jokes, sensitive topic discussions, and misinterpreted images are being flagged and leading to overreactions--up to and including arrests, which can have an adverse effect on these kids' futures.\nThe danger, from a privacy perspective, are twofold: improper implementation of such surveillance methods, and/or abuse thereof.\nIf we assume that security (catching threats, to themselves or others, beforehand) is a justified reason to reduce or eliminate privacy, it cannot be fully automated. A person-in-the-loop method would be necessary to catch false-positives before career- or life-impacting action is mistakenly taken.\nThat's not what's happening. The amount of data being collected is far too great for people to sift through, even when reduced to what the algorithms or AI flag, and the whole selling point of such analytical software is that it will eliminate the need for such costly employees. Thus, these programs (as with any product) will have a QA tolerance: it's not perfect, but good enough for the organization implementing it. How many ruined lives is acceptable then becomes a choice by the organization's leadership (see: the Pinto controversy).\nBut even the best-case scenario for accuracy doesn't preclude the second danger: abuse.\nThis level of surveillance can be used to target people for any reason. Using current methods implemented by schools as a reference, an employer could then fire you for something you typed out and then immediately deleted. A landowner could refuse to rent or sell to you because of a Google search you did. An insurer could deny your claim because of what food you order for delivery. A doctor's office could even refuse to treat you because your sex life doesn't conform to their religious beliefs.\nAnd that's just at the consumer-level. When we consider what this can mean for public safety, all bets are off. Whilseblowers intending to tell the public about unsafe airplanes, chemical dumping in water supplies, or literal crimes committed by companies and governments will be instantly detectable. Victims making anonymous reports because they're too afraid to go public will be easily identifiable. Throw false-positives into the mix, and now you've got a recipe for disaster.\nPersonally I think we're going to see these risk-assessment companies grow with the business model of creating a comprehensive profile by which everyone is rated in various risk groups. How desperate are you for this product, so they can charge more. Are you struggling financially, so they can pay you less. Are you likely to spend time on your phone, take long breaks, leave at quitting hour, not show up early, and sandbag your work, so they can decide not to hire you. Do you have an interest in or own any firearms, so they can refuse to let you live in their community. Do you speed, accelerate too fast, brake to hard, roll through stopsigns, or take sharp turns, so they can up your interest rates (this one's already happening). Do you conform to their political/religious beliefs. Do you have any fetishes they consider objectionable. What health issues do you have. All to maximize their profit and limit their liability--at your expense.\nMost people are apathetic on this issue because their privacy hasn't been violated. They're confident that they still have a private life, and even those parts that they think are vulnerable won't have a major impact should they be compromised.\nBut it will take getting fired or arrested for a 3am, algorithm-provided video you only watched three seconds of to get most people to care. And by then it'll be too late for many, many others.",

      "text": "In Neal Stephenson’s 1995 science fiction novel, The Diamond Age, readers meet Nell, a young girl who comes into possession of a highly advanced book, The Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer. The book is not the usual static collection of texts and images but a deeply immersive tool that can converse with the reader, answer questions, and personalize its content, all in service of educating and motivating a young girl to be a strong, independent individual.\nSuch a device, even after the introduction of the Internet and tablet computers, has remained in the realm of science fiction—until now. Artificial intelligence, or AI, took a giant leap forward with the introduction in November 2022 of ChatGPT, an AI technology capable of producing remarkably creative responses and sophisticated analysis through human-like dialogue. It has triggered a wave of innovation, some of which suggests we might be on the brink of an era of interactive, super-intelligent tools not unlike the book Stephenson dreamed up for Nell.\nSundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, calls artificial intelligence “more profound than fire or electricity or anything we have done in the past.” Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn and current partner at Greylock Partners, says, “The power to make positive change in the world is about to get the biggest boost it’s ever had.” And Bill Gates has said that “this new wave of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone.”\nOver the last year, developers have released a dizzying array of AI tools that can generate text, images, music, and video with no need for complicated coding but simply in response to instructions given in natural language. These technologies are rapidly improving, and developers are introducing capabilities that would have been considered science fiction just a few years ago. AI is also raising pressing ethical questions around bias, appropriate use, and plagiarism.\nIn the realm of education, this technology will influence how students learn, how teachers work, and ultimately how we structure our education system. Some educators and leaders look forward to these changes with great enthusiasm. Sal Kahn, founder of Khan Academy, went so far as to say in a TED talk that AI has the potential to effect “probably the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen.” But others warn that AI will enable the spread of misinformation, facilitate cheating in school and college, kill whatever vestiges of individual privacy remain, and cause massive job loss. The challenge is to harness the positive potential while avoiding or mitigating the harm.\nWhat Is Generative AI?\nArtificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating software capable of mimicking behaviors and processes we would consider “intelligent” if exhibited by humans, including reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and exercising creativity. AI systems can be applied to an extensive range of tasks, including language translation, image recognition, navigating autonomous vehicles, detecting and treating cancer, and, in the case of generative AI, producing content and knowledge rather than simply searching for and retrieving it.\n“Foundation models” in generative AI are systems trained on a large dataset to learn a broad base of knowledge that can then be adapted to a range of different, more specific purposes. This learning method is self-supervised, meaning the model learns by finding patterns and relationships in the data it is trained on.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are foundation models that have been trained on a vast amount of text data. For example, the training data for OpenAI’s GPT model consisted of web content, books, Wikipedia articles, news articles, social media posts, code snippets, and more. OpenAI’s GPT-3 models underwent training on a staggering 300 billion “tokens” or word pieces, using more than 175 billion parameters to shape the model’s behavior—nearly 100 times more data than the company’s GPT-2 model had.\nBy doing this analysis across billions of sentences, LLM models develop a statistical understanding of language: how words and phrases are usually combined, what topics are typically discussed together, and what tone or style is appropriate in different contexts. That allows it to generate human-like text and perform a wide range of tasks, such as writing articles, answering questions, or analyzing unstructured data.\nLLMs include OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s PaLM, and Meta’s LLaMA. These LLMs serve as “foundations” for AI applications. ChatGPT is built on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, while Bard uses Google’s Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2) as its foundation.\nSome of the best-known applications are:\nChatGPT 3.5. The free version of ChatGPT released by OpenAI in November 2022. It was trained on data only up to 2021, and while it is very fast, it is prone to inaccuracies.\nChatGPT 4.0. The newest version of ChatGPT, which is more powerful and accurate than ChatGPT 3.5 but also slower, and it requires a paid account. It also has extended capabilities through plug-ins that give it the ability to interface with content from websites, perform more sophisticated mathematical functions, and access other services. A new Code Interpreter feature gives ChatGPT the ability to analyze data, create charts, solve math problems, edit files, and even develop hypotheses to explain data trends.\nMicrosoft Bing Chat. An iteration of Microsoft’s Bing search engine that is enhanced with OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. It can browse websites and offers source citations with its results.\nGoogle Bard. Google’s AI generates text, translates languages, writes different kinds of creative content, and writes and debugs code in more than 20 different programming languages. The tone and style of Bard’s replies can be finetuned to be simple, long, short, professional, or casual. Bard also leverages Google Lens to analyze images uploaded with prompts.\nAnthropic Claude 2. A chatbot that can generate text, summarize content, and perform other tasks, Claude 2 can analyze texts of roughly 75,000 words—about the length of The Great Gatsby—and generate responses of more than 3,000 words. The model was built using a set of principles that serve as a sort of “constitution” for AI systems, with the aim of making them more helpful, honest, and harmless.\nThese AI systems have been improving at a remarkable pace, including in how well they perform on assessments of human knowledge. OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, which was released in March 2022, only managed to score in the 10th percentile on the bar exam, but GPT-4.0, introduced a year later, made a significant leap, scoring in the 90th percentile. What makes these feats especially impressive is that OpenAI did not specifically train the system to take these exams; the AI was able to come up with the correct answers on its own. Similarly, Google’s medical AI model substantially improved its performance on a U.S. Medical Licensing Examination practice test, with its accuracy rate jumping to 85 percent in March 2021 from 33 percent in December 2020.\nThese two examples prompt one to ask: if AI continues to improve so rapidly, what will these systems be able to achieve in the next few years? What’s more, new studies challenge the assumption that AI-generated responses are stale or sterile. In the case of Google’s AI model, physicians preferred the AI’s long-form answers to those written by their fellow doctors, and nonmedical study participants rated the AI answers as more helpful. Another study found that participants preferred a medical chatbot’s responses over those of a physician and rated them significantly higher, not just for quality but also for empathy. What will happen when “empathetic” AI is used in education?\nOther studies have looked at the reasoning capabilities of these models. Microsoft researchers suggest that newer systems “exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models” and are coming “strikingly close to human-level performance.” While some observers question those conclusions, the AI systems display an increasing ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses, make connections between different pieces of information, and engage in reasoning processes such as inference, deduction, and analogy.\nDespite their prodigious capabilities, these systems are not without flaws. At times, they churn out information that might sound convincing but is irrelevant, illogical, or entirely false—an anomaly known as “hallucination.” The execution of certain mathematical operations presents another area of difficulty for AI. And while these systems can generate well-crafted and realistic text, understanding why the model made specific decisions or predictions can be challenging.\nThe Importance of Well-Designed Prompts\nUsing generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude 2 is relatively simple. One has only to type in a request or a task (called a prompt), and the AI generates a response. Properly constructed prompts are essential for getting useful results from generative AI tools. You can ask generative AI to analyze text, find patterns in data, compare opposing arguments, and summarize an article in different ways (see sidebar for examples of AI prompts).\nOne challenge is that, after using search engines for years, people have been preconditioned to phrase questions in a certain way. A search engine is something like a helpful librarian who takes a specific question and points you to the most relevant sources for possible answers. The search engine (or librarian) doesn’t create anything new but efficiently retrieves what’s already there.\nGenerative AI is more akin to a competent intern. You give a generative AI tool instructions through prompts, as you would to an intern, asking it to complete a task and produce a product. The AI interprets your instructions, thinks about the best way to carry them out, and produces something original or performs a task to fulfill your directive. The results aren’t pre-made or stored somewhere—they’re produced on the fly, based on the information the intern (generative AI) has been trained on. The output often depends on the precision and clarity of the instructions (prompts) you provide. A vague or poorly defined prompt might lead the AI to produce less relevant results. The more context and direction you give it, the better the result will be. What’s more, the capabilities of these AI systems are being enhanced through the introduction of versatile plug-ins that equip them to browse websites, analyze data files, or access other services. Think of this as giving your intern access to a group of experts to help accomplish your tasks.\nOne strategy in using a generative AI tool is first to tell it what kind of expert or persona you want it to “be.” Ask it to be an expert management consultant, a skilled teacher, a writing tutor, or a copy editor, and then give it a task.\nPrompts can also be constructed to get these AI systems to perform complex and multi-step operations. For example, let’s say a teacher wants to create an adaptive tutoring program—for any subject, any grade, in any language—that customizes the examples for students based on their interests. She wants each lesson to culminate in a short-response or multiple-choice quiz. If the student answers the questions correctly, the AI tutor should move on to the next lesson. If the student responds incorrectly, the AI should explain the concept again, but using simpler language.\nPreviously, designing this kind of interactive system would have required a relatively sophisticated and expensive software program. With ChatGPT, however, just giving those instructions in a prompt delivers a serviceable tutoring system. It isn’t perfect, but remember that it was built virtually for free, with just a few lines of English language as a command. And nothing in the education market today has the capability to generate almost limitless examples to connect the lesson concept to students’ interests.\nChained prompts can also help focus AI systems. For example, an educator can prompt a generative AI system first to read a practice guide from the What Works Clearinghouse and summarize its recommendations. Then, in a follow-up prompt, the teacher can ask the AI to develop a set of classroom activities based on what it just read. By curating the source material and using the right prompts, the educator can anchor the generated responses in evidence and high-quality research.\nHowever, much like fledgling interns learning the ropes in a new environment, AI does commit occasional errors. Such fallibility, while inevitable, underlines the critical importance of maintaining rigorous oversight of AI’s output. Monitoring not only acts as a crucial checkpoint for accuracy but also becomes a vital source of real-time feedback for the system. It’s through this iterative refinement process that an AI system, over time, can significantly minimize its error rate and increase its efficacy.\nUses of AI in Education\nIn May 2023, the U.S. Department of Education released a report titled Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Teaching and Learning: Insights and Recommendations. The department had conducted listening sessions in 2022 with more than 700 people, including educators and parents, to gauge their views on AI. The report noted that “constituents believe that action is required now in order to get ahead of the expected increase of AI in education technology—and they want to roll up their sleeves and start working together.” People expressed anxiety about “future potential risks” with AI but also felt that “AI may enable achieving educational priorities in better ways, at scale, and with lower costs.”\nAI could serve—or is already serving—in several teaching-and-learning roles:\nInstructional assistants. AI’s ability to conduct human-like conversations opens up possibilities for adaptive tutoring or instructional assistants that can help explain difficult concepts to students. AI-based feedback systems can offer constructive critiques on student writing, which can help students fine-tune their writing skills. Some research also suggests certain kinds of prompts can help children generate more fruitful questions about learning. AI models might also support customized learning for students with disabilities and provide translation for English language learners.\nTeaching assistants. AI might tackle some of the administrative tasks that keep teachers from investing more time with their peers or students. Early uses include automated routine tasks such as drafting lesson plans, creating differentiated materials, designing worksheets, developing quizzes, and exploring ways of explaining complicated academic materials. AI can also provide educators with recommendations to meet student needs and help teachers reflect, plan, and improve their practice.\nParent assistants. Parents can use AI to generate letters requesting individualized education plan (IEP) services or to ask that a child be evaluated for gifted and talented programs. For parents choosing a school for their child, AI could serve as an administrative assistant, mapping out school options within driving distance of home, generating application timelines, compiling contact information, and the like. Generative AI can even create bedtime stories with evolving plots tailored to a child’s interests.\nAdministrator assistants. Using generative AI, school administrators can draft various communications, including materials for parents, newsletters, and other community-engagement documents. AI systems can also help with the difficult tasks of organizing class or bus schedules, and they can analyze complex data to identify patterns or needs. ChatGPT can perform sophisticated sentiment analysis that could be useful for measuring school-climate and other survey data.\nThough the potential is great, most teachers have yet to use these tools. A Morning Consult and EdChoice poll found that while 60 percent say they’ve heard about ChatGPT, only 14 percent have used it in their free time, and just 13 percent have used it at school. It’s likely that most teachers and students will engage with generative AI not through the platforms themselves but rather through AI capabilities embedded in software. Instructional providers such as Khan Academy, Varsity Tutors, and DuoLingo are experimenting with GPT-4-powered tutors that are trained on datasets specific to these organizations to provide individualized learning support that has additional guardrails to help protect students and enhance the experience for teachers.\nGoogle’s Project Tailwind is experimenting with an AI notebook that can analyze student notes and then develop study questions or provide tutoring support through a chat interface. These features could soon be available on Google Classroom, potentially reaching over half of all U.S. classrooms. Brisk Teaching is one of the first companies to build a portfolio of AI services designed specifically for teachers—differentiating content, drafting lesson plans, providing student feedback, and serving as an AI assistant to streamline workflow among different apps and tools.\nProviders of curriculum and instruction materials might also include AI assistants for instant help and tutoring tailored to the companies’ products. One example is the edX Xpert, a ChatGPT-based learning assistant on the edX platform. It offers immediate, customized academic and customer support for online learners worldwide.\nRegardless of the ways AI is used in classrooms, the fundamental task of policymakers and education leaders is to ensure that the technology is serving sound instructional practice. As Vicki Phillips, CEO of the National Center on Education and the Economy, wrote, “We should not only think about how technology can assist teachers and learners in improving what they’re doing now, but what it means for ensuring that new ways of teaching and learning flourish alongside the applications of AI.”",
