This is due to the growing need for energy-efficient commutes, favorable government policies, rising demand for zero-emission vehicles, and increasing fuel prices, which have compelled two-wheeler manufacturers to explore alternative power sources for their models. The requirement for cost-efficient two-wheelers is also driven by the increasing ICE vehicle prices due to BS 6 norm implementation and the low maintenance cost of EVs.",
