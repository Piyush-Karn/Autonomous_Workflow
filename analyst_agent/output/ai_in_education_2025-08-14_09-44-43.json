      "summary": "In some countries, there are large gender gaps at the primary level with many more primary-school-age girls not enrolled in school than boys, for example in Afghanistan, Niger, and the Central African Republic. While gender disparity at the global level has disappeared for enrollment rates at the primary and secondary level, more needs to be done to improve school completion among girls, and to improve learning outcomes among boys. There are also new gender gaps on the horizon related to digital literacy (UNESCO 2020).",
